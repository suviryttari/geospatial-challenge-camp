Challenge Camp 2023 
=====================

The *Geospatial Challenge Camp* is a new skills development and innovation 
service of `Geoportti Research Infrastructure <https://www.geoportti.fi/>`_ 
and `Location Innovation Hub (LIH) <https://www.maanmittauslaitos.fi/en/locationinnovationhub>`_, 
which is one of the European Digital Innovation Hubs. 
The Geospatial Challenge Camp is a 10-week long challenge-based course (5 ECTS) 
that aims to provide participants a chance to tackle relevant 
real-world challenges in cross-disciplinary teams. 
The participants are doctoral and post-doctoral researchers plus master students 
from Finnish universities and research organizations. 
They will work together in multidisciplinary teams and 
collaborate with mentors and stakeholders.

The course aims to identify and analyze complex location and 
time-related societal problems that requires the designing 
and building of digital impact-driven solutions, scientists from 
various disciplines will work together on real-world sustainable solutions.
Participants will benefit their professional growth regarding the use of data, 
technology, and application innovations stemming from the Geoportti project.

The challenges will be posed by societal actors, data providers, companies, 
NGOs and innovation community actors and they will offer to Researchers the 
chance to expand their data science solutions into new operative solutions
